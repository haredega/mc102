The intent of this page is to share the code I produced during both UNICAMP and Centrale Nantes courses related to programming.

Algorythms - Brazil
- My first ever experience with code. Although very simple, this first approach to C was very interesting and allowed me to begin the understanding of the building pieces of software
 
Algorythms - France
- This second experience was a return to the basics of C, but with usage of different libraries and more complex building for the programs built

Object Oriented Proggraming - France
- In this course I have had a first contact with the main concepts of objects and the ideas of encapsulation and more complex structures such as trees and queues. I wasn't able to find the code for the respective final project.

RaspberryPi - Brazil
- This course is the last one I'll have on the subject. It is mostly about electronics, but RaspberryPi's integration plays a major role throughout the semester. I'll be working on it until july 2016.
